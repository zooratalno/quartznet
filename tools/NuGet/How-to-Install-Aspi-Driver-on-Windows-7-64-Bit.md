## Method 1: Download Windows Driver Kit Version 7.1.0
 
One option is to download the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) Version 7.1.0 from the official Microsoft website[^1^]. This is an update to the WDK 7.0.0 release and contains the tools, code samples, documentation, compilers, headers and libraries with which software developers create drivers for Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2003.
 
To install the WDK, you need to download the ISO file and burn it to a DVD or mount it as a virtual drive. Then, run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions. You may need to restart your computer after the installation.
 
Once you have installed the WDK, you can use the Aspi drivers that are included in the package. You can find them in the folder C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\redist\aspi\. There are two files: aspi32.sys and wnaspi32.dll. You need to copy both files to the folder C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\ and register wnaspi32.dll using the command regsvr32 wnaspi32.dll in an elevated command prompt.
 
After that, you should be able to use your Aspi devices on Windows 7 64 bit.
 
## Method 2: Use a Third-Party Aspi Driver
 
Another option is to use a third-party Aspi driver that is compatible with Windows 7 64 bit. There are several Aspi drivers available online, but you need to be careful about their source and quality. Some of them may not work properly or may contain malware.
 
One of the most popular and reliable Aspi drivers is Adaptec's ASPI layer version 4.60 (ForceASPI)[^2^]. This is an unofficial version of Adaptec's original ASPI layer that works on all versions of Windows from 95 to 10. It supports both 32-bit and 64-bit systems and does not require any installation.
 
To use ForceASPI, you need to download the ZIP file and extract it to a folder of your choice. Then, run the file killaspi.bat as an administrator to remove any existing Aspi drivers from your system. Next, run the file instaspi.bat as an administrator to install ForceASPI on your system. Finally, restart your computer and check if your Aspi devices work.
 
## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to install Aspi drivers on Windows 7 64 bit using two different methods: downloading the Windows Driver Kit Version 7.1.0 or using a third-party Aspi driver such as ForceASPI. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, so you can choose the one that suits your needs best.
 
We hope this article has been helpful for you and that you can enjoy using your Aspi devices on Windows 7 64 bit without any problems.
